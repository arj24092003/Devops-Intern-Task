I created a Dockerfile to containerize the Django application. In the Dockerfile, I installed the necessary system and Python dependencies, set environment variables for Python, copied the project files, ran Django management commands to migrate the database and collect static files, and finally configured Gunicorn to serve the application.
I also created a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the services. In Docker Compose, I defined a web service for the Django app and an Nginx service as a reverse proxy. I configured the web service to use the Dockerfile, set environment variables, expose port 8000, and mount a volume for static files. The Nginx service uses the official Nginx image, maps port 80, mounts the Nginx configuration file, and shares the static files volume with the web service.
I created an nginx folder, and inside it, I added a default.conf file. This configuration serves the static files from the Docker volume and forwards all other requests to the Django application running in the web container. I also included security headers in the configuration to improve the application's safety.
I attempted to configure GitHub Actions for continuous deployment, but I was unable to complete it due to time constraints.
